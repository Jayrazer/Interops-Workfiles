this compile can be hacked/re-compiled what ever you do with it is really up to you, 
However if you do just a simpile re-skin and want to re-post it. CONTACT ME FIRST!!!

If I feel the skin/model/compile edit is deemed releasable (most of the stuff is but im referring to the people
who do shitty jobs in five min), I will allow a re-upload


NO EXCEPTIONS

Oh btw if there are anybody missing from the credits plz someone tell me
thank you.
